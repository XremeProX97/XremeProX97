# Greetings and welcome to my GitHub Account.
Hi and welcome to my GitHub account.

## What languages do I know?

So far, I know these languages:

- node.js.
- Javascript.

## What am I good at?

I am good at coding Discord bots with multiple features, such as basic moderation, manage Google assets, Roblox Groups and other features.

I am also good at helping people by coding and building Discord bots for them, but in order to do so, I'll need them to provide a Discord bot name, a Discord bot profile picture and other configuration settings and systems they want to have for their Discord bot.

## Is there a way you can get into contact with me if you want a custom Discord bot?

Yes, there is currently a way you can reach out to me. These are how below:
- Discord (XX_XtremePro_XX#1484)
- GitHub DMs.
- Contacting me on the Autocode Discord server (https://discord.gg/autocode).

## Do I have any permanent Discord bot projects?

Yes, I currently do have 1 Discord bot project I constantly work on. The name of the Discord bot is known as "Terminal". These are it's features:
- Multi Server compatible.
- Basic moderation commands.
- Manage Google Drive based assets.
- Roblox Group management. (Promotions & Demotions within the Roblox Group(s).

## Is there a way I can hire you to create a Discord bot?
So far, unfortunately, the answer for this one is no, the reason for my answer is that I don't have a way to add new Discord bots to my Autocode Project and I can't locally host it right now, as soon as I get funding and money then the answer will change to "Yes".

## How do you plan to work on Discord bots with more advanced features with Autocode?

To answer that question, Autocode is curently attempting to update their Discord API so we can do more advanced features as we need to do.

## Do you know how to make automated moderation systems?

Yes, I know how to do that but to do so I need some APIs to do that job since I don't know how to do it manually.

## Do you know how to create Ticketing systems?

Yes, I know how to do that and I know how to make it advanced by linking it to the Airtable database so it can make it more... Helpful as well as beneficial to the moderation staff of your Discord server and whatnot.

## What is my perferred payment method?

My current perferred payment method are the following:

- PayPal.
- Klana.
- As well as other secure payment methods.

## Who are your client(s) so far?

Sadly I can not reveal my current client list due to certain... Privacy reasons but all I can say is that they hired me for the right amount of money.
