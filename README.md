I am good at coding Discord bots with multiple features, such as basic moderation, manage Google assets, Roblox Groups and other features.

I am also good at helping people by coding and building Discord bots for them, but in order to do so, I'll need them to provide a Discord bot name, a Discord bot profile picture and other configuration settings and systems they want to have for their Discord bot.
